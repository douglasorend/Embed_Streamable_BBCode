[**By Dougiefresh**](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=253913) -> [Link to Mod](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=4138)

--------

## Introduction
This modification adds a BBCode to view Streamable.com videos and pictures.

The BBCode takes these forms:
    
    [streamable]{streamable URL}[/streamable]
    [streamable width=x height=x]{streamable URL}[/streamable]
    
where **{streamable URL}** is like **http://streamable.com/e/8l7dn**.

## Admin Settings
There are two new settings on the **Modifications Settings** page:

- Streamable default width
- Streamable default height

## Compatibility Notes
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.13, but should work on SMF 2.1 Beta 2, as well as SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.

This mod should be installed after [Tapatalk mod](https://www.tapatalk.com/download_SimpleMachines.php), if you want to use it with Tapatalk.
